take to verify the business manager he told me 1 3 days i trusted his words and bought the 120 fb business manager verification though btc because he didn't want to do it through playerup middleman now suddenly after i paid him he sent me a message where he says that fb got some changes so he will stop the verification for a bit i asked him what him kind of changes facebook has no answer i asked him how long it would take no answer i told him that i have to know it immediately no answer i told him to send me my money back still no answer and that's why opened the dispute against him because i think that he stole my money i uploaded you the telegram chat between me and him tagging kenny g kenny g suddenly contacted me after i opened the dispute and told me that he is suddenly able to upload the documents i immediately saw that as suspicious because the day he told me that he definetly cannot upload the docs and that the service stops because of facebook since he told me that he is suddenly able to upload documents i thought that he is uploading fake documents to put me still because i opened the dispute here in playerup now after a couple of days i see inside my business manager that the documents he uploaded were declined i contacted him and told him that he says that they declined the documents because i removed his access from my bm and that this is the reason for the decline wtf since there is no proof that something near as that exists inside the facebook rules he has to send me my money back i mean it is obvious that he tries to find a reason to not refund me kenny g has to refund me because of the following reason 1 he promised me a service that i did not receive 2 he has a 7 days money back guarantee 3 his excuse to not refund me is invalid since he first told me that i should not remove him out of the bm after i already sent him my money and after i already gave him access i would have never ever purchased from him if he told me that i'm not allowed to remove him 4 there is also no proof and no rules inside the facebook guidelines that facebook is going to decline documents if a person inside the bm gets removed which is btw pretty unlogical to think that so he tries everything to find a reason to not refund me the telegram chats between me and him tagging kenny g for the last time or i'll be forced to take action against your account hello help mustafag is a less responsible buyer and dont respect my selling and technical policy let me summary the case easily for u 1 mustafag messaged me for buying business verification for his bm facebook business manager 2 i received his order and payment then i added his bm to my facebook profile prepared the business document and upload document to facebook for reviewing 3 because facebook is sensitive and the its algorithm is very complex i told him just wait for facebook reponse and no need to do anything 4 he asked me about removing my profile out of the bm because of suspicious issue bla bla bla i already warned him don't do it because this action will affect to reviewing process of facebook algorithm and he agreed with me that dont touch to my profile until the reviewing proces is completed by facebook 5 after 1 2 days he removed my profile without any announcements at that moment i can't the bm is under review by facebook algorithm the reviewing process is not completed yet then i messaged him about it and can't guarantee for any result by facebook in this case because customer didn't follow seller's process and just want to do by their way 6 i think that customer have to take responsibility for what they did they can't ruin the seller policies just by doing whatever they want so customer shouldn't do things by the way they want that without announcements because it will affect to work perfomance and time of sellers if customer followed step by step of my process then im able to take responsibitlity for it if having any issues i think u will agree with me help finally 120 is not big money but i just want customer will be learned more about responsibility and respect thanks and waiting for your decisions help help said tagging kenny g for the last time or i'll be forced to take action against your account click to expand btw we're diff timezone a bit and i don't work on sunday as well so sometime it will slow abit thanks for your sympathy kenny g 1 there is no proof that facebook has a rule that they decline business documents just because someone was moved out of the business manager that is one of the most illogical things i've ever heard there is in fact no connection between the reviewing process of business documents and removing someone out of the business manager look inside the guidelines ask a facebook worker ask mark zuckerberg himself everyone will say that a rule like that does not exists 2 you first recommended me to not remove you out of the bm after i already send you my money and after i already opened the dispute here on playerup you are talking about buyer responsibility but you never ever mentioned something like that because you knew that i would have not purchased from you then where was you seller responsibility in that situation 3 most of the current bm verification service seller are saying that currently most of the documents will get declined by facebook so the bm verification service is not that reliable and good as you know what's funny even you told me that on the 10th march you texted me with the following messages hi bro fb got some changes so the service will temporary stop a bit screenshots are attached so you yourself said that fb got changes that cause you to stop the verification service why have you uploaded documents if you knew that fb got some changes you knew for yourself that the chance that my bm will get verified with your documents is very low because of the new changes of fb but you still uploaded the documents so again where was your seller responsibility 4 you market your products with a 7 days guarantee so usually you have to send me my money back without any questions asked kenny you knew from the beginning that the bm will not get verified i asked you if i can purchase the bm service though your playerup product page but you immediately said please don't buy on playerup i asked you why not playerup they have middleman service then you told me playerup is a scammer they never send money to me your payoneer skrill didn't work because you wanted me to send you the money through btc because then i cannot take the money back when the uploaded documents get declined screenshots are attached conclusion you market your products with a 7 days guarantee but you don't stick to it you knew that fb got some changes but you still risked it and uploaded the documents you said that removing you out of the bm is the reason of the decline but you never showed any proof you told me that playerup are scammer so i send you the money through btc you are talking about buyer responsibility but you never ever not a single time showed any seller responsibility please send me my money back to my btc wallet 1eysnzh3cnrzqre3tbkpmk2tivkqddqvx5 thank you mustafag said 2 you first recommended me to not remove you out of the bm after i already send you my money and after i already opened the dispute here on

quite some time it's forgoten really but my statement stands every time that is 100 of the time when i ask if an account is for sale it's because something happened sometimes users are unaware sometimes excuses are trown around but in this case time has passed and the topic is still open with the account for sale same for this https www playerup com threads wa nekramech screenshots in description 4649997 topics usually follow a trend if the account is banned which is very common btw the user will mark it as sold or lock the topic in this case it does follow that trend yes this account is banned aswell https www playerup com threads wa mods and primes more in description 4622458 but those 2 1st topics i mentioned they aren't locked the accounts are still for sale and the seller has been entering online for a very long time so those banned accounts seem to be for sale intentionally i'm not sure what mods think of this to me it's a scam how do i know they no longer exist simple go ingame and type profile username if the accound didn't change his name which will reflect on the forum and isn't some sort of bot because bots do not have profiles then the game should return a profile page with the looks and stats in these cases the game cannot find such user and that means they have been removed i can confirm that when users realize the issue they update the topics appologizing and updating the topic but this user when i spoke he replied with what does not exist account mean i looked at what you write on the forum as i understand you have a hobby to insert your opinion where you are not asked reported your profile keep in mind that i have never been wrong about these situations it's not 50 of the times it's not 99 9 it's 100 this obviously is the tip of the iceberg 2 accounts knowing a 3rd was banned but the user is selling many warframe accounts and sadly i cannot confirm if those even exist or if he's just making something up the 2 i checked are gone for sure as for the rest i guess we can rely on the sellers word knowing very well he lied about the avaiability of atleast 2 accounts this user has never bought on this site and does not understand how the delivery of goods works if the product is out of stock or as the user says it is banned then the buyer will not be provided with this product but simply a refund will be made also the user does not know that the game has a change of the game nickname for in game currency and tries in vain to search for users by nickname in the screenshots for all the time i have not had more than one problem with warframe accounts also these accounts can be sold and sold on my other sites and as a result a buyer who is a dishonest player can ban him this is to the question that the account you found was banned this user is either a competitor or he has a lot of free time and does everything he can to spam in my offers i ask the site administration to deal with this user this user absolutely unreasonably calls me a fraud which i am not i reiterate every single time i mentioned this i'm right here's an example provided by the user himself user has already acted as this topic is now locked following the trend i stated earlier https www playerup com threads wa nekramech screenshots in description 4649997 however this one https www playerup com threads wa nd frames screenshots in description 4641623 is still for sale i'm not competing breaking any rules or anything of the sort i'm simply giving users a chance to make it right and adress the topics some do and some do not no name change was made since the accounts still exist in the forums it's ingame that they went poof so we are on 1 out of 2 it will eventually be 2 out of 2 this entire a refund will be made isn't an excuse to sell a banned account i know it and he knows it otherwise the 1st link i posted would contain an account for sale and if you check now topic is locked as for every other account god knows if they are ok or not maybe someone can check that out i ain't doing that filu said however this one https www playerup com threads wa nd frames screenshots in description 4641623 click to expand account is available and not banned more questions there is no blocking in the personal account on the warframe site i logged into the game and the account was really banned i apologize the account has been marked as sold thanks accounts are banned for violation of the user agreement people saw a nickname on screenshots and sent complaints about warframe accounts this is sad in fact the accounts were banned for not smearing nicknames on the screenshots as i predicted 2 out of 2 i was right just like the many this topic can be locked seller has finally followed the trend by locking topics of accounts that can no longer be obtained sadly i cannot confirm other accounts ingame as in the actual game not on the website but seller does seem a tad more stuburn adressing the issues making acusations because he believes i'm somehow to get him i would use caution when trading with him sellers should refrain from exposing any unique information of the account such as username nickname or account id as it can lead to the account getting banned blocked this goes to all games not just this one alone\",\n",

would i be able to log on if you need to send me the code via your email you got that first and tranfered to your gamil and game canter i already told it to the middleman and in my first picture is the proof you send to the thread you fool after that you dont have to get the second time you are always tranfering from one to another and i cannot get back my account you are a real robber i havent seen a bigger robber yet i attached a picture again you can see the exact time and infos that this person using my account right now he transfer from one mobile or account to another every day in his time zone and i cannot get my account back middleman please check bekesi6386 said i attached a picture again you can see the exact time and infos that this person using my account right now he transfer from one mobile or account to another every day in his time zone and i cannot get my account back click to expand did this occur while you were playing the account nobody stole his account on the ticket he gave me access to the account and then a whole 24 hours later i lost access to the account i ve tried to log in when he gave me access to his twitter log in because he changed it but the verification code wasn t being sent to his email at that time it was very late so at that point i didn t even worry about it the next day he claims i ve stole his account but how would that even be possible if all his information is linked onto the account so therefore he would need to send me a whole verification code in order for me to sign in not only that even if he did give me access and he receives the money he will still have access to the account because you cannot remove your social media from the account therefore if he was the received the payment and i had access to the account he ll just take it away from me again like he did the first time i find it to be ridiculous that this person right here is wasting my time and any of the playerup moderators trying to scam people for 100 as you can clearly see when i get on the game it gives me a whole error code not allowing me to play the game that picture is not even his own i was able to find almost an exact picture on google images like come on dude middleman 0 it has never occured when i played with the game 1 hinatasonlyfans the only person who got the full account details with passwords after it he transfered to his gmail game center at this point he got the account 100 and he can retransfer it from anywhere he doesm't need my details anymore i already attached this picture of the first proof but i do this again 1 st attached picture 2 after the robbery he realized that he doesnt have to pay he can retransfer it and didnt answer my messages in the thread he was playing with the game for days when i realized it i retransfered it and saw that he alredy made his teams and playing wit the game i told it to him but he denied everything of course 3 the game doesnt let the player transfer within 24 hours again in the picture you can see since then he has two phones in one one he always transfer it and playing with the game after one day he transfer it to another phone and continue to play 4 the other pictures of course is mine i attached more of that the middleman can see the picture infos in the screen shot you can see the exact time and details 5 hinatasonlyfans is already a high risk dealer in this site 6 i just want my account back from him or the money for it bro what does me being a high risk have to do with anything i ve bought multiple accounts and sold an account on this site without any issues you love you the high risk tab is honestly there for no reason cause the middleman can see all he previous sales or purchase and see they all went perfectly fine all you re doing is posting the same screenshots and not using any proof dude you know you have the account and you just wanna scam someone for 100 cut the act and stop being a little childish scammer and just tell the truth and go scam somewhere else i of course made teams on the account when i got it and like i said 24 hours later i lost access and since then i haven t been able to play the game so please stop the lying and wasting me and the middleman time cause it s starting to piss me off these are the newest picture i am not showing the same pictures the middleman can see the picture details 1 the attached screen shots 1 6 show that you are playing with the game right now and tranfering from one device to another to stop me getting back the account i am the only one who show proof of the robbery 2 i can start transfer if i start a new game after i delete the whole game the screenshots show that i am not playing with my account the only man who got the account access is hinatasonlyfans the middleman can see the screenshot exact datetime you are a scammer and a liar 3 you have another negative feedback from january i attached it too he says too that you are scammer i think you stole from him too middleman another negative feedback from a troll someone who didn t buy from me on this website the middleman would be able to see if that person had purchased and account from me or i bought one from them lol you re showing pictures of the game when you first open it it from downloading lol you just logged off your account log off and why i cant transfer please tell me i show 3 different days when i cant log and transfer how i am the only one who is showing proof you are just lying all the time and the middleman can see that you are who shows nervousness and negation these are the tipic robber lyar definitions you re not showing proof none of that is proof all you did was delete the game and showed options from the main loading screen that s all not only that it s been 3 days since you ve replied i wonder why you clearly had nothing to say cause it caught you in your lie so please tell the middleman the truth so we can end this back and forth atrocity\",\n",

in the future i strongly recommend in the future to use playerup middleman services to protect yourself from these type of scams here is how it works for buyers middleman buyers guide playerup accounts marketplace player 2 player secure platform and here is how it works for sellers middleman sellers guide playerup accounts marketplace player 2 player secure platform what can you do next to resolve this issue since this is a paypal transaction you need to immediately go to paypal and open a dispute hopefully the seller moves those funds in order to do that go to your paypal receipt and see the area where it says resolution or dispute payment open a dispute and provide them as much proof as possible contact paypal as well and ask them what you need to do to win a dispute keep in constant communication with paypal if you sent the payment by family and friends then unfortunately those funds are lost as you cannot dispute those payments and we strongly advise against sending friends and family payments in the future even if the seller requires it you can easily say no for more information please contact paypal can playerup provide compensation for this dispute since this is a non middleman transaction and playerup wasn't directly involved with safeguarding your payment and guaranteeing your transaction we will unfortunately not be able to provide any compensation for you on this transaction as you dealt directly with the individual for which you're submitting a complaint against in this ticket however if you're able to locate his full name and address we can

all chat logs and additional information below will attach chat logs i have all messages from 3 way with middleman and seller helloslayer below attached will be all conversations between seller and myself on discord which was his profiles channel for conversation so attached will be screenshots showing and after of the hacker thief who changed the email from the listed middlemen convo email to another and screen name changing the others show my email to prove ownership account linkage in crossave and so on here are more pictures to explain my side it shows the account when sold to me email was changed to mine then it says on steam no account with that email can be found then on my destiny 2 companion app you can see again my email\\xa0protected email is verified then later is changed to an email that i am not the owner of and i was verified somewhere else also the steam account purchased is now listed as private and changed to some sort of asian lettering as the name which my name was shaxxistraitor also a support claim has been filed by me with steam to show my account was stolen and my information changed middleman help tagging helloslayer tagging help so what are the steps from here if the seller won't respond i've tried this messaging him on discord shows he's been active here quite frequently sorry for such a delayed reply i am still at work i'm sorry to hear what happened to you and let's see if we have a way of fixing this first let me provide the basis for the conversation moving forward as this is important piece of information if you message on that discord and get the reply block it as soon as possible two months ago i had unfortunate case of stolen identiy my debit credit cards and emails were affected so i'm almost done with the process of replacing all of the information i am more than happy to contact you on discord if you and trust me i am not trying to avoid you second i am more than happy to assist you of getting this account back the only major problem is the original email i used on the account no longer exists as i had to delete it now we all might think okay if my email was hacked surely someone got a hold of my info and could easily portray themselves as me and recover that account that's very much possible however i deleted that email two months ago as well as my other yahoo accounts yes yahoo are the worst with the security however if this would be the case i'm sure you would be raising this ticket here months ago now here's the kicker and i had to look into this myself i accepted few steam gifts few years ago and it is possible for the person who gifted me a game to pose as account holder and retrieve it back however it is highly unlikely someone after few years would go and say you know what i want this account third if you remember i was the one pushing you to use middle man as it's a lot safe and i stand by my decision not to get involved with destiny 2 anymore and it would be just odd for me to try and recover the account months after sale as usually such attempts result in epic failure i am more than happy to link you to other website i usre frequently and i sold few genshin impact game accounts and had no issues at all from people that bought accounts fourth and please don't take this the wrong way i am not trying to accuse you of anything however anyone that is playing destiny will find this suspicious can i ask if you by any chance used any recovery service trials carry i did some digging with the picture and the account name you provided and please be honest with me because when i checked destiny 2 stats it's either someone was hacking on the group you played with or which is more likely ddosing oposing team as there are 5x matches in a row where you win within a minute and it continues for 5x matches in a row it's not unusual to load in to empty match but 5 matches in a row that's usally the sign of recovery service and everything is suspicious about the group the light level the kd a i don't know and i'm so sorry trust me i am not trying to attack you please check images i attached of what i found these matches are from a week ago as i mentioned i am more than happy to try and get this recovered but the problem is because email is deleted there is hardly any evidence that account even belonged to me i know it's hard to believe for either you or the moderator but come on why would i do that months after sale i will wait for your reply thank you so much for the reply and i'm sorry for accusations but i'm do stressed over this had no idea what was going on and you were my only lead sorry for your issues with the old email and identity issues now yes i did use a trials recovery service last weekend because i was off of town and couldn't play but i used the account info from my xbox not my steam info you had given to me now how they got into steam i have no idea and didn't think that was possible if there's any way you can help me i am in dire need if it the account is what i want nothing more i tried working with steam but they're refusing because i'm not the creator i can still access the account through my xbox because i have silver on the account and they can't unlink it due to that so whomever this is doing this will be stopped ok i will contact steam the only problem is as i mentioned my claim to the account is the address that i used on it account info and email i used those are the only details i have which is pretty weak but as the whole email was deleted these are the only details i can give so if steam refuses to help i have no idea what to do and i would ask help an advice and sorry as i mentioned it's not my intention to accuse you or anything it's just i've seen so many posts on destiny forum and reddit where recovery service gone wrong another thing is i thought maybe bungie could help with this but it looks they they are as good as useless as their stance is basically well we can't do anything it's super stressful i get that and i've been there but all we can do now is wait and see what steam can do i will wait for them to reply and will drop conversation screenshot in here help can you reply and help

and help us with this somehow what is the procedure if steam refuses to give the account back click to expand thank you again helloslayer i've screenshot the ip address of the person whom did the recovery luckily my router and my xbox picks up on that stuff when something is unusual so i have that info also i have the ebay messages and screens screenshots of the guy i purchased from whom hasn't disappeared yet he also defended himself saying how would he have hacked steam or even gotten in through xbox login alone they are completely different logins and passwords also were never discussed between us any help on this would be wonderful you and from help any tips what could bungie do i also went through steam they denied me since i'm not the creator so godly you have more luck even if the address is gone for recovery purposes it should work they just want established history and payment history which obviously i couldn't give oh no you're right even if that email does not exist they should help but the you are right in saying if they ask for some purchase history i am royally screwed so fingers cross let's wait for few days and see what steam decides to do it's 9pm here for me so if you don't hear back from me later today i am sleeping most likely i'm working tomorrow as well but will be available after that if you need anything just drop a message in here

clearly someone is posing as me so i guess we will have to wait for another day and a half for steam to come back now there is a glimmer of hope i need to reach out to my friend and ask if he still has a heroes of might and magic vi disk i gave him as this game is on that steam account and cd key on the back of the case would be pretty strong prove of the ownership of the account as that game was added to steam by me like 6 or 7 years ago i'm at work for the next 6h and will have to do some work around the house so if you don't hear back from me today i will update you once steam comes

for all you're doing steam replied basically asking to provide a proof of ownership so they need a copy of purchase made in that account my buddy did found the cd and will email me the details once he

       " \"account got blocked and buyer does not want to give promised support good evening thank you for allowing me the chance to explain the reasoning behind my report this is an on going dispute with buga who i bought a mega account from here https www playerup com threads mega nz lite account 400gb limit 4714786 on december the 5th i purchased a mega account from buga via paypal using the link he provides for the purchase it redirected to playerup com which no longer exists on december the 7th the account was blocked and as per buga s request in his post i contacted him posting any negative reviews specially because he states that if a negative review is left talking to him there is no replacement if you leave a negative review contacting me there will be no replacement buying the account i read the terms of his post and his promises in case of problems you will receive a replacement during the warranty period if there is no replacement then you will get a refund which was another good reason to contact him in good faith instead of posting something negative in the forum i contacted buga through telegram and dm in playerup as he was not replying finally we had a conversation in telegram where he stated that the accounts sold are cracked and that sometimes they get blocked therefore as he specifies in his post that he will offer a replacement or refund in case any issues arise i inquired about the warranty he offers in the post for a new account to which he replied we don t provide any warranty on cracked accounts and when i pointed out what he wrote in the post he claimed that it is a common line in all his listings implying that it does not necessarily mean what it says after seeing that i was not getting a replacement nor a refund i opened a case with paypal to get my refund as i believe he is in the wrong as he is selling something and promises some level of protection but when it comes to it he provides no protection whatsoever he began to ask me to close the case many times as they as sellers don t like cases it seems he only cares about his reputation but not about maintaining it he also began to call me a scammer and to say that i breached the terms and conditions by accusing me of multiple login attempts to the account or the use of vpn or changing the credentials of the account it seemed he was trying to blame it on me so paypal would not refund me i don t know if this is a scam case or not what i do know is that this buga person sells accounts that depend on luck of being blocked or not and that while he advertises that he will take care of any problem in case one arises he does not and he does not plan on taking care of it he states that there is no warranty my issue more than losing the 10 is with the fact that he made a post promising a set of conditions that he is not fulfilling i think that is misleading and quite frankly false advertisement thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to express this issue 1 date dispute happened example december 7 2020 2 are you the buyer or seller example i'm the buyer 3 total transaction value example 10 usd 4 other parties username example buga 5 method used to pay or

scammer i delivered account in well and good condition as mentioned in my thread i thinks mega nz blocked account due to suspecious activity like vpn logins i sold all my mega accounts without any problem and that was my last account in stock as buyer saying his account blocked after one day if account blocks at the first time buyer logins then its our fault then we can give me replacement or refund but buyer not used him properly but its ok we asked buyer to give us sometime currently mega accounts are out of stock but buyer created dispute in paypal buyer lefted negative review on thread even we are co opertaing with him and continuously replying him he created dispute in paypal without asking anything even we were replying him we requested please close this case we will try to replace account in 1 2 days and if not so we will refund you but buyer ignored us i also thought to create dispute here but because this is wrong buyer is not coopertaing us please help me and solve this and if possible remove negative cooment on mega thread thier is also not opption to create middleman buy now link in mega threads buga said first of all i am not a scammer i delivered account in well and good condition as mentioned in my thread i thinks mega nz blocked account due to suspecious activity like vpn logins click to expand did you inform him about if they use vpns or any sorts of suspicious activity like that that it would probably block ban the account prior to your transaction so what is your proposal to the buyer in order to resolve this issue make it simple and clear help said did you inform him about if they use vpns or any sorts of suspicious activity like that that it would probably block ban the account prior to your transaction so what is your proposal to the buyer in order to resolve this issue make it simple and clear click to expand help sir buyer not contacted us buying account it was dir ect checkout mega accounts only block because of using vpns or switching location very quick but its ok if this situation occured we can solve it i requested buyer many times that we will replace it in 2 3 days as they are stock currently please give us time or we will refund you after 2 3 days if we failed to replace account clearly account not blocked because of our mistake but i think 10 is not so much big that you can't wait and start a case in paypal even we are repling every single message of him on telegram and requseting him to give us time to solve it help sir we don't left any possiblity that buyer open a case on paypal thats our first paypal case yes we refunded some buyer when they were right but this time buyer is doing very wrong 10 is not big amout that i can't refund but dear buyer opened case in paypal and we can't refund him in opened case because paypal cases effect paypal account and us also i don't like disputes or negative feedback anywere thats why i do my job honestly help if you think its my mistake or i scammed buyer please let me know thanks drnight12 need your response here help said drnight12 need your response here click to expand thank you help as i previously mentioned i do not know if this is a case of scam or a case of false advertisement as my issue is entirely with buga promising replacements or refund in case any issues arise and when the issue arose then he told me there was no such warranty the account got blocked i don t know why buga told me that it depends on luck sometimes they get blocked sometimes they last for more than one year but somehow i am being directly blamed for the blockage when asking for the replacement that was promised in the original sale post in his original post buga states asks to do not change any account details like password or email do not add or remove any profiles which i did not do i followed this instructions as he clearly labels that in case the buyer does not follow them the warranty is void if you break the rules your warranty stops and you get no replacements while he says that i used vpn and keeps insisting on it i did not i did not use vpn nor changed the account credentials nor deleted any profiles i just logged in copy pasted the credentials once and that was it however i was not notified or informed about the fact that i shouldn t use vpns or that that could lead to a block ban you can see the email i received with the credentials below the only reason i opened a paypal case is because buga informed me that there is no warranty and that his line promising to take care of issues is just a common line in all his listings leading me to believe that i was being hung to dry and that i lost the 10 i paid in fact you can see how buga still does not think he has done anything wrong in his previous post he states that they have indeed refunded buyers in the past when they were right but that i am doing very wrong as i ve stated my issue is more with his undelivered warranty and promises to take care of the situation more than the blockage itself i understand it can happen but the sole reason i bought it from him is because he promises a replacement in case something happens which is why i followed all his rules and contacted him in private going public here and opening a case on paypal thank you for your attention drnight12 said thank you help as i previously mentioned i do not know if this is a

advertising something you are not delivering your post literally says in case of problems you will receive a replacement during the warranty period if there is no replacement then you will get a refund but when problems happened you said it s just a common line and that there is no warranty i am sorry but this is you lying on your original post in playerup i am not lying here as help can see on the screenshots i have posted that that is indeed what you said your post is at best misleading but very likely just false advertisement and i like the fact that you mentioned your website where i left the ratings because i was going to link it here https playerup com product mega nz account but you just deleted the whole website which is weird too but anyway i was going to link it for help to see that i did not post 3 negative reviews one after another i posted 3 negative reviews because you kept deleting the reviews i posted with screenshots and proof of this very same exact thing we are discussing here in my opinion by deleting the negative reviews you are just proving me right but don t want anyone to see know but i could be wrong of course i don t see how i have crossed every limit by complaining a dodgy practice that provides 0 protection to the buyer but to keep peace i will suggest that help has enough evidence here to make a decision and i think we should let them speak kind regards edit the website is up again however i am banned now there buga said you are 100 liar and just want refund that is not possible you not followed terms and condition and that is 100 true help if i am even 1 wrong then ban my playerup account this buyer crossed every limit click to expand it seems like you are 100 sure that it is drnight12 's fault why the account got blocked can you explain to us here how you could tell whether its the buyer's fault or not why it got blocked drnight12 can you send us a screenshot of the message where it says the account is blocked help said drnight12 can you send us a screenshot of the message where it says the account is blocked click to expand yes of course below there are 2 screenshots i am using splitscreen so it can be seen that i

during checkout now he is proving me wrong help you want any proofs from me please let me know click to expand dear buga as you might have noticed we are on playerup and i ve expressed my biggest issue being the fact that on playerup you state in case of problems you will receive a replacement during the warranty period if there is no replacement then you will get a refund this is my main issue and i said i believe you should at least modify your post to remove that and or specify that there is no warranty as you claim i would also like to point out that the website i bought the account from was www playerup com not www playerup com therefore i nor you cannot guarantee that the text displayed was the same on both sites also privacy policy is not the same as terms and conditions and lastly i would like to quote your own text if any issues occur after that only warranty on the account applies and no refunds are accepted you say that while refunds are not possible warranty applies to the account but then on private you said what warranty when i asked you about it i will repeat this once again as you don t seem to understand what the issue here is your post on playerup com is misleading and false kind regards help said buga do you own this website https playerup com privacy policy and do you have any proof that you asked them read the policy from this website you proceed with your transaction drnight12 did you read this click to expand yes i have read that and i will also say that when you buy from the website they make you tick a box agreeing to the privacy policy however what he quoted i am not sure if they are still the same on the website as i am now banned give me the reason again as i explain in the text above thank you for your attention kind regards help said buga do you own this website https playerup com privacy policy and do you have any proof that you asked them read the policy from this website you proceed with your transaction drnight12 did you read this click to expand yes i own this website help when we create account it asks to checkmark i accept the terms of service and privacy policy same when we

convo with him in his upload you can read it there i suppose mistermuscle dispute against you that's 30 stolen account is totally off the point on this case to be honest it's not a stolen account it's an account i've purchased and was reselling just like the others the seller i've bought it from apparently charged back on the game purchase the buyer hasn't asked for support to me at the first place either so at this point i'm curious as to how exactly playerup works since i never gave any guarantees for the account i was selling you can check the thread since i didn't have any guarantees while buying either and i can't get refunded from whom i've bought so in this case i'm waiting to hear from playerup to tell me what's supposed to happen here and i'll be willing to cooperate on a solution that makes total sense keep in mind that the customer was able to play the game for about a month after purchase and the fact that i cashed out the funds i've taken from this payment via btc method btc crash waiting to hear from playerup now mistermuscle states he will be refunding you let us know how this progresses thanks to both of you for being civil about this muscle was scammed just as you were vixien this isn't his fault so please don't direct your anger at him i didn't i spoke calmly with him after i found out he was scammed too i understood this was made i spoke to him anyway i'm glad i could at least get my money back i'm waiting for it mistermuscle you have a couple disputes opened actually this is what triggered some delays on your cashouts usually it's okay to have 1

active i said today a few lines above it was to owner who logged i don't play this game 2 36 am nukacola nor it was sold to somebody else 2 36 am nukacola that's why you have my warranty 2 50 am martin's minglee this statement means i would not have full access to the account is this account being shared by other people i did mention it so is the owner aware that his her account is being sold through a third party do you have contact with the owner of the account at all 2 52 am martin's minglee if not i would like to use my warranty to see if there's a similar account that's currently inactive by the owner and has a similar pet 2 54 am martin's minglee because if i were to play on the account right now while the owner of the account is unaware that their information was sold then there's a high chance the account will be locked out 6 07 am nukacola you can use your warranty if you get locked only not to choose other accounts since i shared already this password with you and the passwords cannot be changed play with it and if it get locked then you can use warranty i've sold such accounts and there are no problems if the owner is still acitve it still didn't got locked for other i have 135 succcesfull trades i know what is going on and you don't know better if you try force a lockdown on purpose it's no more warranty that's the end of it 11 10 am martin's minglee how can you tell if a lockdown is forced or not not trying to overstep my bearings but this is ridiculous you tell me that there'll be no problems if i play on an active account with the owner playing on it but that means there's no guarantee that it will get locked down immediately the moment i actively play on it as well especially if you don't have contact with the owner of the account which questions how you got the account in the first place edited 11 15 am martin's minglee you can't tell me i don't know better man that's insulting and all i'm doing is questioning if it's safe or not to freely play on the account 11 35 am martin's minglee so you either tell me that the owner actively knows that the account he owns is being played on and agrees to it and providing proof of that 11 36 am martin's minglee or give me a replacement account otherwise i'd like a refund 5 39 pm martin's minglee a 5 39 pm bot clyde your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with

it's a good idea to sell an account with the owner who's active on it the same day of you selling it for 200 if you played rotmg it's glaringly obvious if someone else logged on your account you should only be selling inactive accounts a refund must be given and a suspension is placed on your account until this is resolved ryan cheers the buyer was fully refunded via paypal please lift my

works if not then yeah we will just reduce the price i read and it says when you pay from credit card we charge fee its free when you using bank account oh i think i see maybe if its fast i can try to enter my bank account number and reg my bank account with paypal that would save you hassle in the future ya thats weird why they charge your card love you the banks thats why i just use paypal but if you are ok reduce to 50 like that i will skip to give them my number they have to chek up my bank account and this could take a few days okay just reduce the price i dont mind if we re start the

deal was 2 weeks or less it is now november 16th 2020 and i have only received 16 000 of the 100 000 promised amir requested that i confirm delivery ahead of time so he could use the money to pay for the followers i included this dialogue on the middleman deal in the event that the followers were not delivered here we are almost 2 months later and the followers were not delivered i uploaded a variety of screenshots from the middleman deal to confirm that i am not fabricating amir's false promises i have been more than patient over these 1 5 months and amir has the audacity to request even more patience from me at this rate followers will take close to a year to deliver not nearly 2 weeks i am requesting a refund for the remainder of the balance i paid 412 usd for 100 000 followers which equates to 4 12 per 1 000 followers since 16 000 followers have been delivered 16 000 1 000 16x 4 12 65 92 worth of followers have been delivered this means that 412 65 92 346 08 usd that is still owed to me i would like a refund for this remaining balance the chat dialog is below and i also included me and amir's conversation from yesterday november 15th via whatsapp i hate that it has to come to a playerup dispute but in light of recent events it is clear that it will be quite a while i receive what i paid for and i am not sure that there is much trust here anymore i can file a dispute via paypal for this middleman deal but will only do so if necessary requesting immediate assistance by playerup mods and help help ryan maki exe support middleman mod requesting assistance tagging amirhossien69 he bought a 100k follower for 400 i told him it takes time and he has to wait this is not my problem i did not work for a few days for a negative in my profile it started today he has to wait evident in the chats amir said the delivery time is 2 weeks or less i have been more than patient and have allowed 3x his projected delivery time it s been a little over a month and a half which is 6 weeks and only 16 000 of 100 000 followers have been delivered in 6 weeks this is not remotely comparable to 100 000 in the promised 2 weeks at this rate it will take 37 5 weeks for completion i have been more than patient but enough is enough i explained to him either he has to wait for it to be completed or i have to create new pages and get one of them he has seen that i got into trouble with that and he created this group and got money he thinks i am a witch and i print money with a machine i see no reason for him to form this group i talked to him on whatsapp and told him hanzo said evident in the chats amir said the delivery time is 2 weeks or less i have been more than patient and have allowed 3x his projected delivery time it s been a little over a month and a half which is 6 weeks and only 16 000 of 100 000 followers have been delivered in 6 weeks this is not remotely comparable to 100 000 in the promised 2 weeks at this rate it will take 37 5 weeks for completion i have been more than patient but enough is enough click to expand well enough what to do now do you have a better solution than waiting i have no money even 1 in my account you know my problem i even took 250 of my black family 1 1 month salary به and gave it to him you have to wait for it to be completed i did not work for 1 week because of this the seller has not offered me a reasonable solution besides waiting i am not waiting any longer as i have already waited for plenty of time stop acting like a victim and like your clients owe you something this is not a case of empathy i do not owe you patience or extra time even though i gave you 3 times the amount of time that you requested contrary you owe me 346 help please review this dialogue i have said what i needed to say and expressed my concerns and desired solution ryan maki exe hanzo said ryan maki exe click to expand i gave the necessary explanations if you want to speak no problem nothing will be sent to you when my account is blocked i officially went bankrupt and i have no money if you calm down by suspending me from your site i have no problem i have no hope for work anymore i'm tired i wish we understood each other a little more goodbye the seller claims that they do not have 1 in their account if he was paid out this 412 usd for the 100k followers he was supposed to deliver then that means he did not commit my payment to my followers and he used the money elsewhere in either situation amir has been dishonest hanzo said the seller claims that they do not have 1 in their account if he was

send the money will send a screenshot as soon as done i didnt want to deal with this stuff so i just sent him back his account here are some screenshots as proof administrator blurred all email adresses and passwords for security reasons if administrator wants the screenshot without blur message me and i'll send it he is in full control of the account account again admin unfortunately the account is not any longer in his original state and by having tampered with it it does no longer have his original value and uniqueness i would consider the matter solve once the payment gets done and the payment request to the paypal account was sent on saturday so there is no excuse to have not payed for it unless the email provided wasn't correct admin paul8691 i upgraded like 1 card it was still level 7 for a reason plus it wasnt yours to do anything at all yes it was at level 7 at like 99 xp so when i leveled up 1 card it leveled up again you are just confirming you changed the account status and therefore its value also fyi spending 7k gold isnt leveling one card the value only went up by getting a higher level that is how the game works if you have no knowledge of what an engineered account is then you should have never had interested in this account unfortunately a level 8 cannot be considered engineered specially when the deck focus was broken admin how would you suggest we solve this furthermore i have no guarantees that there is no access to the account withtout linked google id 1 you are just making stuff up right now because you never told me anything about that is was an engineered account you just advertised it as an account with a few cards capped not that is a deck focus neither will i have guarantees that you havent linked the account to something else this is a pointless discussion either you openly were truly interested in the account but took too long to pay or you tried to scam me but then backed off and now you are trying to walk away freely nothing changes the fact that you changed the account details without any type of payment or authorization nor that you intentionaly changed the account status i suggest that you complete the purchase through the middleman services and we can consider this matter solved i suggest you just take the account and walk away i was going to pay but now i am not just because i said i was busy and you kept spamming me and you couldnt even wait a little whilst i said i was busy and then you immediatly started this thread i dont want to deal with those people so i just returned the

seller was unwilling to corporate with me nor provide assistance in obtaining valid credentials seller mentioned this was his private account and credentials so there is no way he could of changed them advised seller to reset account information on account since it was his private account and email seller said he could not do so because credentials were changed which doesn't make sense since every directv account comes with an account number that he can use to revert credentials back to normal i provided the seller with every option and opportunity to assist me and he's the one calling me a scammer tagging premium guru help middleman i provided the account screenshot why i scam this guy middleman knows that i completed more than 5 directv orders recently successfully this guy changed the credentials directv is easy to change the credentials i also tagged middleman on the 3 way because i know i am correct also middleman knows i am a legit seller i never intended to scam anyone this guy playing stupid and victim card he is just here to scam atleast help middleman support you should have to believe me because i am selling since 2019 and with more than 190 positive reviews please i need your help playerup team take right decision because i also wanna make this scammer free and this guy is making this site bad reputation thanks victim like i mentioned above you've done nothing to help me out and only accused me of scamming from the get go i provided you with numerous solutions and you have a rebuttal for everyone youre the one that came up with that sob story in the first place so if it serves me right you're the one playing the victim tell me premium guru if you sent that screen shot of confirmation that you paid that account there should be an account number that was provided to you with that account number that you never provided you could of easily contacted directv or gone online to changed the credentials if i were truly the one to change them you're the one playing stupid here premium guru you even mentioned that this was your private account and email so no matter what you would have the power to overried any changes i provided you with multiple screenshots and video to prove the information was invalid middleman this guy is a hack all he ever does is bring up his reviews reputation and how great he is i've literally tried everything to pretty much help my own self with solutions and this guy is useless and only points the finger notice how he only brings up his previous orders like he did on this posts and says it's impossible for him to have sent invalid credentials i had messaged this guy my order was placed because i'm a first time user so i wasn't clear on how to proceed so this guy is just trying to take advantage of the situation and twisting it on me why don't you try assisting your buyer here to fix the issue first premium guru you don't need to be so defensive give your buyers the benefit of the doubt and help them if they ask for assistance not jumping into any conclusions like they were trying to scam you or anything help i am not meant to be defensive i could help the buyer but i can't because not even password and mail full credentials has been changed i contacted directv and told them about my issue they sent me my old i'd i have also the mail ss i will put here too i really don't wanna any of buyer to suffer but tell how can i help him because i lost the account completely directv said the i had concerned to change mail and also the changes made in your account is done after logging into the account premium guru thanks for atleast trying this screenshot proves your email is still associated with the account the account has not been simply lost the email you provided me on our initial 3 way conversation is completely different than the one shown here in the screenshot which email is the correct one email\\xa0protected or email\\xa0protected that's an email alert by the way directv did not send you the old user id that's the email that's already associated with the account the email states that the security questions and answers were changed but my issue is that the credentials provided were incorrect which you are accusing me of changing even though i never had access to begin with and now your sending a screenshot of an email you never provided to me in the first place so how would i have changed the account information if the account information was never correct to begin with help middleman any updates here premium guru spidet23 no sir he took the account my payment is pending for this order support support as you can see premiumguru is still pointing the finger without any cohesive or factual evidence that i took the account please read his most recent response

feedback as well now about sale being a fraudster is i don't have anything to say about it 'coz he has done transactions that were completed 1 first of all sale deceived rushi is that the middleman doesn't trading it is not fair moreover personally my opinion is that sale would trade his account directly because it has some problems that is why he lied about middleman's trade service 2 and about fake feedbacks it is common problem if you look carefully into the trading history of some sellers they have duplicate feedbacks and maybe fakes so i think in this case if even sale asked about

that the youtube channel was bad gms1688126 he purchased a monetized channel and the monetization was disabled gms1688126 insisted he did not upload any new content to the youtube channel during this timeframe gms1688126 stated that he believes the channel had issues prior to this sale ytbabe responded on june 12 2020 saying the channel was fully monetised and i told the buyer just to delete the movies and nothing else and she kept poking the channel and got it demonetised i told you to leave the channel alone and just start building the channel but you kept pushing until you got the channel demonetised now you want another one that channel has been with me for a very long time and i had no problem with it and just four days with you it got demonetised while you were poking and pushing every button on the channel gms1688126 responded on june 12 2020 saying i did nothing the channel was cancelled and profited after my purchase the channel had problems it was sold ytbabe responded on june 12 2020 saying the channel had zero problems except one strike which you were aware of you accepted to buy it at this point lets wait for a middleman to join us and posted this evidence gms1688126 is now requesting a refund and ytbabe is unwilling to give a refund requesting assistance from all moderators and staff so we can speed up a resolution here he reported it on june 13 not june 12 he reported it on saturday the 13th of june after 4 days of refusing to accept that he has received the channel from me the channel was delivered to him on the 9th of june they could fix the issue if both parties cooperate with each other what the buyer could do here is give the access of the yt channel to ytbabe so they could check which video s caused the demonetization of the channel of course gms1688126 handing the account over to ytbabe you should take some screenshots screen record of the current state of the account just for precautionary measures such as proving that you did not upload any videos prior to the issue if the root cause of the issue is are removed then the channel would be eligible for monetization and possibly take back the monetization status again hence will resolve the dispute i would only consider refund if after he reapplies for monetization yt denials it i strongly believed he made one of the videos private or unlisted which led to demonetization then made it public again i can provide the login information of this channel to the intermediary and the intermediary can log in to the channel to view prove that i did not operate the channel as the seller said yes i can invite the seller to become the administrator of the channel and let the seller check it by myself proving that i have not lied if the seller agrees please give me your email and i invite you please middleman reply ask the seller to give me your email address and i invite you to become the administrator of the channel i can only refund you if after you reapplies for monetization yt denials it that's the only ground i can refund lets wait till then the next application for profit is july 13th if i wait until this time my money can already be transferred from the middleman to the seller's account i now invite the seller you can view the channel clearly the middleman can also log in proving that i have not cheated the money can not be transferred because the trade is marked investigation opened so wait until next month when yt denials it gms1688126 said please middleman reply ask the seller to give me your email address and i invite you to become the administrator of the channel click to expand lets hold off on another party accessing the account for now and work to get this matter resolved both you and the seller seem like honest members it's just an unfortunate bad string of luck the channel got demonetized however it does seem like something that can be fixed here by potentially reapplying well wait until july 13th of next month i press the application button again until then i will not do anything with the channel well wait until july 13th of next month i press the application button again until then i will not do anything with the

a difficult buyer i agree and for that we will not be able to support anymore transactions from him in the future because he isn't flexible enough to work with us or sellers he was very harsh to you and most buyers don't act like this your buyer didn't want to wait either on this transaction he wanted to cancel we did try to convince him to continue but he refused to wait we have to be quick and

certain words in profiles like secure playerup middleman admin etc and some way to prevent scammers from making false forms otherwise what security is there when scammers are circulating like wolves among the sheep exactly like the bot above academiaimvu said it seems like he lost his money but he earned experience click to expand to me it looked apparent what he was trying to do but i'm only going to give him a warning here since he is a victim reportedly based off the information he provided above so he may not be thinking clearly with his actions obviously being a victim doesn't give

in pm and 3 way conversation 9 provide all chat logs and additional information below well i messaged him here on this site this morning but seller didn't reply to my messages on why he removed access to the account and is logging into the account this transaction was completed on 12 11 15 judging from middleman's last post stating the transaction was then complete there was no problem till i received 2 messages on my phone asking for password reset on android for this account i did not request any password reset and also i had 2 step verification enabled so i rejected the password reset and ignored the 2nd attempt thinking it was still the old request today i was unable to log onto the account on android and while logged in on ios i was disconnected by someone logging into the account i messaged supercell requesting an answer on why i am not able to log onto the account anymore on android but no reply yet and anyway seeing as someone is on the account he would probably get the same answer from help and support as i would the fact is no matter how many times the password is reset or changed the seller can just keep un linking the account what is the procedure here middleman he seemed like such a nice trustworthy guy i would never have thought he would do this and take the account back he even gave me all info for the account i still can't believe it that's why i messaged supercell asking for an explanation he seemed like such a nice trustworthy guy i would never have thought he would do this and take the account back and we gave each other positive feedback too so it's just sad update contacted supercell providing all the info they requested and i assume the seller is doing the same thing in order to retake the account keep getting disconnected got the message you are not logged into gamecenter please log out then log into your gamecenter account which i did right away and thankfully my village was still there is there any way to resolve this well you can request the support team of supercell to unlink it to its current g and gc they will ban the coc account for 2 days and remove it from every device it is currently logged in you mentioned that he gave you all the info if its for the coc account then you should try that thanks rolan i did contact the devs and provided them with all the info they requested the problem is the seller already got the account un linked when this whole thing started so he has all the info too and is also in communication with the devs this morning he tried logging in several times and then i was disconnected from my gamecenter even though i never logged out the game asked me to log back into my gc account in order to access the village which i did immediatley fortunately the village was still there i also asked the devs if they could stop the unlinking oh okay the account might get banned as different users are requesting the same process i'm just guessing is your money is still in middleman 's possession or has it been disbursed already middleman already gave the seller the money as he told me when he received the payment i also messaged the seller but got no response so far wafs said hey bro i got paid today the problem is they only sent me 216 51 via paypal instead of 250 they also said that they were having problems with bitcoin that's why they've sent it via paypal is this normal there's a big difference see i'm missing 33 49 and you previously said that you've paid a total of 265 i've sent them a message and i hope to get a proper explanation click to expand he sent me this mesage when he got paid dated wafs 12 7 15 middleman should be able to help you with this have you included an insurance package during your purchase no insurance package but middleman did send me a message dated 12 20 15 middleman said insurance package activated click to expand supposed to be good for 120 days in case something happens after the order got back word from supercell turns out the info he gave me was not correct so he knew what he was doing from the very beginning there's no way that i can recover the account now middleman can you help me get my money back please this guy has covered all his steps he even gave me the account apparently giving middleman a hard time too when we were doing the transaction middleman knows this seller as the transaction was completed not too long ago and it took weeks to verify the seller i just dunno how to prove he recalled the account except i can provide screenshots of my conversation with supercell you should tell supercell that you've bought that account from the owner so they can disable it for good if you can't have what you paid for nobody should have it that's a thought btw i noticed this seller has sold 5 accounts on this site all after the account he sold to me so beware he told me he only had 2 accounts his and his wife's and he is selling because they are not playing anymore middleman to check those too releasing payment but this guy is smart he probably waited till he got payment from all sales making his move to recall the account mine was the first one sold maybe he will recall the other ones too now i understand this scammer's strategy when i purchased the account it was an almost maxed th10 and i have been steadily working on it he gives me all fake info with the intention to keep total control over it even after it's sold now he recalls the account and it's a pretty decent th11 with eagle artillery gw lv5 and a good portion of upgrades done besides getting the queen to level 40 didn't spend anything on it either now he recalls the account and gets an upgraded base without having done any work on it he could have been doing this all the time middleman i put my faith in you i sure hope you can get my money back middleman any update on this i have no acess to the account anymore as the seller has gotten the village unlinked from both game center and android posted details

payment again i really don't understand if this site is genuine or not it looks like the only way to get in touch with the admins or service dept is to pay for an account upgrade and if my last few weeks have shown me anything else i wouldnt be suprised if that also didnt change anything i told my cc company i didn't think it was fraud but now i'm unsure i'm curious if others on the ite have had

sincerely want to understand what motivated you send me all screenshots i'm waiting for a message from you my contacts whatsapp 375257572151 telegram seclime2b discord seclime2b 6696 i have studied this question in more detail i managed to log in the email he did not change the password and i have one question are you trying to deceive us now we have been in this business for many years and the middleman system has been working for many years and everyone knows that order processing takes at least 2 weeks and the seller will not change the password and return the account never it's silly because the buyer might make a refund in that time but you wrote about the problem after 3 days okay 1 you have signed in account 27 dec spoiler proof 2 you changed username 3 times spoiler proof 3 you successfully logged in inst on january 5th spoiler proof 4 every 2 days you logged into your mail from the same ip from which you logged into your account for the first time you have not denied that you are logged into your account your ip is in the history of actions spoiler proof your ip 47 40 120 75 174 253 192 6 4 if you had problems with your account as you said in the early days then you would actively try to refund money or contact me you just canceled the order and hoped for a miracle you probably thought that there were only fools here help middleman his ip in action history this is solid proof that he logged in and used it for a month i need your help protecting me from such people i can t say for sure that he is cheating other people by selling this account but that here is cheating me my screenshots prove the history of actions contains all dates and ip there is no point in restoring your account because it will be blocked for this so i want to get my money i've been waiting for a month and we have to set a deadline it can't last that long help hello look at all the evidence and give an answer we have been waiting for a whole month month this man was silent for a month this is not the behavior of customers who have problems with their account he just canceled the order and hoped for a miracle or will we wait another month for the next message from this person first time he logged into account 16 minutes after delivery this is proved by the history of actions in the email and his ip is displayed in the history of actions for the whole month afterwards stefan177 sorry stefan seems i have caused some confusion with my post i'm not the buyer or accusing you of anything at all i was asking you about your progress because i'm in the opposite situation with a different seller not you and haven't been able to get anything sorted in the two plus weeks since this happened it's getting close to the time limit if i wish to pursue a fraud investigation with my credit card company for a refund and i was hoping to get your opinion on if the site is itself fraudulent and if not how you resolved the issue as it seems you are still in the middle of the process i triggered the landmine apologies and good luck cruorsitis i confused you you have similar usernames sorry this site is just a sales area it is not a rogue site if you have a dispute then you need to create a separate thread in this section and technical support will sort it out everything works here for a very long time but in the end the problem will be solved help the

everything in the 3 way conversation https www playerup com conversati e 1 viewmode condensed paginationmode dynamic you can check the email we provided to the buyer and see the account is got locked after delivery we explained to the buyer in 3 way conversation they cant contact supercell support it will get the account locked and they have done it anyway so it s obvious now who s trying to scam cause they claim they never got into the account and we never delivered altho there is proof in the 3 way conversation that they say they got in and tried to change the email as its not possible cause they shouldn t contact supercell and they did our delivery form is clear we warn them about this and its buyers responsibility after first login to keep the account safe i m open to any suggestions from hulk to resolve this faster the buyer is got the account banned by mistake and the fact that they are lying about it is not cool but still we are open to a good suggestion on how to resolve the matter faster i just read their claim again the user is claiming we sell stolen accounts what is the penalty for such a false claim as they are trying to sabotage our name and reputation here clearly this user needs to be punished if he cant prove what they are talking about that they cant hulk everything is in the 3 way conversation i never even got access to the account because those false login details don't work and just came up with a message telling me to sign in using a different id this scam seller then said the account was locked see 3 way conversation now they're saying the account is banned so even his stories are not consistent keeps making stuff up saying i contacted supercell when i didn't only people i contacted are playerup and the seller to inform that cannot login to account seller has made no attempt whatsoever other than blame and try to walk away with the money if seller isn't selling stolen accounts then tell me why seller can't fix it when clearly it said in the screenshot of the locked account 3 way conversation that it was locked for security reasons and asked to enter a code to unlock it if seller has legitimate ownership and rights to this account they will be able to obtain that code and unlock it but seeing as seller is now saying account is banned it can only mean it never belonged to seller in first place possibly an account stolen off

delivery note to change email to secure account this is not changing linked email account through contacting supercell the same email account was maintained throughout with just a name change 2 first login failed it is not after first login first login was never successful no account was received to begin with 3 no conditions of sale were breached as i did not contact supercell furthermore conditions set within seller notes released after payment should not be valid it is essential that all information be put on the sales page not after payment of an item product when a buyer is not provided full conditions of sale transaction it is a scam 4 seller should not be arguing blaming but working productively to amend the problem with the product that they attempted to sell all account details were returned back to seller day 1 buyer has obtained nothing as seller has made no attempt to do that looking at the 3 way conversation it is clear their only intention is to take people's hard earned money and go suggesting they know full well what is going on behind the scenes best deals instead of making false allegations as you have done since day 1 how about actually addressing these statements hulk i have said everything there is to say and all evidence is in the 3 way conversation and likewise the seller will not have any more to say other than blame me so it is up to you and playerup now stop this bullshit you claimed here that account has never delivered but you said in the 3 way that you have logged in and tried to change the mail on the account you said that all your self now here you claim that you never logged in so stop your bull love you stories i logged in to the email account to secure it not the game when i tried getting into the game using that email account it leads to no game account get it right cr_shadow said i logged in to the email account to secure it not the game when i tried getting into the game using that email account it leads to no game account get it right click to expand thats what you are saying now and we have checked and saw account is locked banned so your bullshit story and your lies are clear here the support here can login the mail them selves and see you re lying that you said it s not sending any codes but it does and the account has been banned by contacting supercell support or something and the fact that you called us thieves i will make sure you get banned from here cause you said we sell stolen accounts and i want proof of the bullshit you said here about us upload the proofs where did you saw we sold stolen account what kind of proof you have if any im 100 sure you dont have any proof cause we didn t even sold 1 account that was not 100 legit and this false claim will get you banned from here

well what is going on behind the scenes click to expand i've been saying that since the start it's your story that isn't consistent not mine answer these statements above you talk if you have any legitimate ownership to that account to sell it go unlock it then if you can't there is every right to assume you stole that account off someone else which is why it's locked banned my proof is in the screenshot at the bottom of this dispute op that is the screenshot i saw when i tried logging in to the game for the first time after changing the email i received the two factor email entered the code but no account was found it was you who said it was locked banned so you must know more that i don't how could i have contacted supercell when i couldn't even open the game account in the first place all the account details are back with you if you can't fix it then you can't sell it any more threats from you i'll make sure you never scam anyone again someone needs to look into this in detail asap i think you'll find it is you who will get banned seller is selling false stolen accounts upload the proofs for this bullshit statement or you will 100 get banned im waiting hulk please ban the buyer if they don t upload any proofs first you say it was locked you clearly can't unlock it or explain why you can't unlock it seemingly avoiding the topic altogether when there is clear evidence as seen in 3 way convo that only a security code is needed to unlock a code i presume you don't have because you know it is a stolen account so now you say it is banned altogether well i sure hope hulk looks into this because lmao looks like you've ran out of excuses and have to use lowly big bold writing tactics to seek attention shame on you scammers like you are disgraceful to society best deals said seller is selling false stolen accounts upload the proofs for this bullshit statement or you will 100 get banned im waiting click to expand the fact you can't unlock it is already proof that it's a stolen account lmao cr_shadow said the fact you can't unlock it is already proof that it's a stolen account lmao click to expand you re just fullofshit thats the only fact here best

am confident that the person reporting me is the scammer now you would be saying why would this person be reporting me as he has the account the answer is yes he has access to the account and was playing rainbow six siege and gta 5 on my account for a day but i unlinked these accounts from my psn which means he will need to log back into the accounts of these game which he cannot do so he is mad that i logged him out and he can't play anymore which means the account is useless i did not found anyone reporting you support said i did not found anyone reporting you click to expand why has my account been flagged as high rish then https www playerup com support tickets knowledge base why is my account flagged high risk 76 support said https www playerup com support tickets knowledge base why is my account flagged high risk 76 click to expand so after going back and forth with psn support i got my account back make sure to use middleman always support said make sure to use middleman always click to expand hey what about the high risk situation could it be that the scammer might have used bots or asked a bunch of his friends to report me it is just hurting the reputation to sell

username example essentialworker 9 provide all chat logs and additional information below he stole back the account that i bought from him on april 11th i opened the epic launcher earlier tonight and my account had been signed out which only happens when the accounts info was changed i tried logging back in with my credentials and they wouldn't work so i checked the email that was given with the account and to no ones surprise the password was changed on that aswell during checkout he claimed that the email was not linked to anything and that there was no recovery from his end i believed him at first and confirmed the order and received all the account info later i went to change the email password and was prompted that i would only be able to change it if i received a verification code from a phone number the last two digits of his phone number were shown i was suspicious at first but realized that all gmail accounts these days ask for a phone number when creating one so i thought that he was forced to have added it when making it i didn't want to bother him after the transaction had been done so i left the password unchanged since i was going to change the epic accounts email address to mine anyways after the 3 month wait period was up in july epic email addresses can only be changed every 3 months he claimed that he had just made the email i bought it so only he and i knew the password for it and as explained above his phone number was attached to the email so he had complete control anyways despite him saying that he didn't the email for the account was email\\xa0protected the pass he gave me for it was 49vh4j 4aebg i doesn't work now and if you try to sign in it'll have the last 2 digits of his number as one of the recovery options so you can see for yourself obviously i don't know his number so i'm locked out of both the email and epic account below are the login attempt screencaps i took and the info of him saying that he had no way of

dispute thank you for your cooperation on this matter and sorry to hear about the problems you experienced trigger trigger by for cheeky pleb re 1 trigger tagging essentialworker i had nothing to do with this i am willing to work with the buyer to find a compromise i logged out of the email as soon as i had sent the account details and i had not touched it accidentally posted the same thing twice dude i put an authenticator app for the 2fa on the epic account only email access could disable that and change the accounts credentials you said in the mm order that the email was new so only you could have known its info and judging by the pass you put on it see above there's no way that anyone could have guessed that and just logged in and changed it's pass out of nowhere especially since your number is hard locked onto the gmail they would need the verification text code from your phone in order to change it's password if you really didn't have anything to do with this and want to cooperate then simply sign into the email since your number is hard locked onto it then open it on a browser and scroll to the bottom of the page on the right look for last account activity and click details post screenshots of all of the locations that signed into the account you can put a black bar on 3 4 of the ips so no one can fully see yours or mine but leave enough that they can be differentiated then go into the emails settings go to accounts and import then click on other google account settings from there click on secure account then click on your devices and post a screenshot of the devices connected to the account i'm still waiting he's probably not gonna log back on so i'll just go through more ironic points instead it's funny how he sent me this called his account theft a compromised account as if this is just a random unfortunate occurrence that can happen to anyone acts like he had absolutely nothing to do with this and said he would cooperate read above only for him to go dark after i reiterated that literally only he could have done this it's also funny how he went dark just 2 minutes after i posted my reply to reiterate another one of my points i posted this dispute the other night i tried logging back on the accounts email and was locked out so i looked at his playerup profile and saw that he was last online earlier that night then when i tried to reset the password on the email and was prompted that i would need the verification code that was sent to his phone he logged on the site about a minute later i really don't believe
